## About

The idea for this application originated from a TikTok video that featured a "formula" to calculate one's dating viability based on superficial attributes such as face, height, and body. The video encouraged viewers to follow along and determine their subjective rating. To simplify this process, I figured Iâ€™d create a calculator based on the Male Physical Dating Market Value Formula. Calculator will take user inputs for these attributes and compute the rating dynamically. This application aims to enhance user experience by providing an interactive and seamless way to calculate and display the dating viability score based on the given criteria. Its dynamic nature makes it an excellent case for practicing input handling and real-time data display in React.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
